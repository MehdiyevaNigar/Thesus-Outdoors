Our founders get to know the owners and employees and take the time to understand their current sustainability standards and future ambitions for how we can together work toward operating within planetary boundaries, centering community wellbeing and the planet. This process is a personal one, that takes the vetting process well beyond certifications and helps to ensure we are partnering with suppliers whose values are already in alignment with Thesus’ goals of operating within planetary boundaries with a focus on nature based solutions. As of July 2022 we have moved 100% of our production to Portugal, beating our goal of an HDI rank by 3% achieving an HDI 0.864."
